# FEMTIC
FEMTIC is a 3-D magnetotelluric inversion code based on the following studies. FEMTIC was made using object-oriented programming with C++. FEMTIC enables us to incorporate topography and bathymetry into an inversion model. FEMTIC is applicable to land magnetotelluric survey data as well as ocean bottom magnetotelluric survey data.

## Release note
***v4.3*** Feb. 6, 2025: The directory for the out-of-core files of the sensitivity matrix can becomes changeable.

***v4.2*** Mar. 25, 2024: I modified some parts to allow the use of large-scale models and large datasets.

***v4.1*** Nov. 9, 2021: This new version supports difference filter. The error calculation of log10(apparent resistivity) is modified. Rotation angles of distortion matrix are limited to from -90 to 90 (deg.) when gains and rotations of galvanic distortion are estimated.

***v4.0*** Jun. 3, 2021: This new version supports non-conforming deformed hexahedral mesh.

***v3.5*** Jan. 11, 2021: This new version supports observed data of apparent resistivity and phase and unsymmetric roughening matrix.

***v3.4.7*** Sep. 4, 2020: The integer indices into the multiple right-hand-side vectors and solution vectors were changed from 32-bit to 64-bit.

***v3.4.6*** Sep. 2, 2020: This version allows us to make resistivity of every individual subsurface element to be a different model parameter, in analogy with other 3-D inversion code.
